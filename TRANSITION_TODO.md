# Tempso Webflow → Next.js + Tailwind Migration — Audit & To-do

This document is a consolidated audit of the Webflow export in this workspace and a prioritized, actionable checklist to convert the site into a Next.js project using Tailwind CSS. The goal: keep the current homepage layout/styles/animations while moving to a maintainable React/Next.js codebase.

## Immediate assumptions
- The Webflow export root is the workspace root; the homepage is `index.html`.
- The `css/` directory contains the Webflow-generated styles: `normalize.css`, `tempso.webflow.css`, `webflow.css`.
- All images are in `images/` and Webflow JS in `js/webflow.js`.
- A folder `tempso-com/` exists; we'll use it as the Next.js project root.

If any of these assumptions are incorrect, tell me and I'll adapt.

## Quick contract (what we deliver)
- Input: existing Webflow export files in this repo.
- Output: a `tempso-com/` Next.js project scaffold that reproduces the homepage (`index.html`) using Tailwind for styling. Javascript interactions reimplemented in React (Framer Motion recommended for animations).
- Success criteria: visual parity for the homepage, working interactions, clean project structure, and scripts to run/dev/build.

## Progress
- Project bootstrap: COMPLETED using `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint and the `src/` layout. The scaffold was generated in a temporary directory and copied into `tempso-com/` to preserve this `TRANSITION_TODO.md` file.
- The Next.js app includes a TypeScript app directory (`src/app/`), Tailwind-enabled `globals.css`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, and starter assets in `public/`.
 - Static assets: COMPLETED — copied `images/` into `tempso-com/public/images/` (195 files). No local font files (woff/woff2/ttf/otf) were found in the export, so `public/fonts/` is empty.

Files copied:
- `images/` → `tempso-com/public/images/` (195 files)
- `public/fonts/` created (no files found to copy)


## Files to audit (present in repo)
- `index.html` — Homepage (primary source to port)
- `css/normalize.css` — normalization; Tailwind provides a base layer, so this may be replaced.
- `css/tempso.webflow.css` — primary Webflow-generated styles; large and contains many selectors.
- `css/webflow.css` — additional Webflow CSS/runtime.
- `js/webflow.js` — Webflow runtime interactions/animations.
- `images/` — all static image assets used on the site.
- `template/` — additional template pages and docs; not required for now but worth scanning for assets.

## High-level recommendations
1. Use Next.js (app or pages) — prefer `pages/` if you want simple static export, or `app/` for latest features. Either works. For minimal friction use `pages/` initially.
2. Use Tailwind for layout & utilities. Convert simple layout rules to utilities and keep only the complex rules in a small `globals.css` or CSS modules.
3. Reimplement Webflow interactions in React. For complex timeline animations use Framer Motion. For simpler show/hide or scroll-triggered classes, use React hooks + IntersectionObserver.
4. Avoid copying the entire Webflow CSS blindly — it is large and uses global selectors. Instead, progressively convert pieces to Tailwind and import only the necessary styles.

## Detailed to-do (ordered, actionable)

### 1) Project bootstrap (high priority)
Status: COMPLETED — the project was generated using `npx create-next-app@latest` with the following options: `--ts --eslint --tailwind --src-dir`.

What was created:
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js` (generated by create-next-app)
- `src/app/` with `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `globals.css` (Tailwind enabled)
- `public/` with starter assets
- `node_modules/` and lockfiles (installed during scaffolding)

Suggested scripts (already present in `package.json`):
```
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "next lint"
```

### 2) Copy static assets
- Copy the `images/` directory to `tempso-com/public/images/`.
- Copy any fonts used (if present) to `public/fonts/` and register via @font-face or Tailwind config.

### 3) Create pages & layout
- Create `pages/_app.js` to include global CSS (Tailwind's base + preserved rules).
- Create `pages/index.js` and port `index.html` structure into JSX.
- Break the page into components: `components/Header.jsx`, `components/Hero.jsx`, `components/Features.jsx`, `components/Footer.jsx`.

### 4) Tailwind integration & CSS migration
- Install and configure Tailwind: `tailwind.config.js` with content pointing to `pages/` and `components/`.
- Create `styles/globals.css` and include `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.
- Search `css/tempso.webflow.css` for design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing). Add them to `tailwind.config.js` theme extend so you can express them as utilities.
- Convert straightforward layout and spacing rules to Tailwind classes in JSX. For complex components, use CSS modules (e.g., `Hero.module.css`) and keep those rules scoped.

Notes on Webflow CSS:
- Webflow often generates unique class names and global rules that are not safe to copy directly. Use it as a reference and port only what you need.

### 5) Interactions & animations migration
- Inspect `js/webflow.js` to identify behaviors (e.g., nav toggles, scroll animations, Lottie, sliders, forms). List each behavior and reimplement in React:
  - Nav open/close -> React state
  - Scroll-based reveals -> IntersectionObserver + framer-motion
  - Timelines -> framer-motion sequences or variants
- Keep an inventory of event listeners in `webflow.js` to replicate.

### 6) Accessibility & SEO
- Ensure all images have alt tags in the JSX. Add Head metadata in `pages/_document.js` or `pages/index.js` using `next/head`.
- Make sure the nav is keyboard accessible and dropdowns focus-trap appropriately.

### 7) Build, lint, test
- Add ESLint (Next has starter config). Run `npm run build` and fix any syntax issues.
- Create a small smoke test to render the homepage (Jest/React Testing Library) if desired.

### 8) Performance & optimization
- Optimize images (use Next Image component later). For initial pass, keep static images in `public/`.
- Remove unused CSS and keep Tailwind production purge set (content paths) to minimize size.

### 9) Final review and deploy
- Verify animation quality and accessibility preferences (prefers-reduced-motion).
- Prepare deployment (Vercel recommended). Add README with commands.

## Audit notes & potential gotchas (from a quick read of the export)
- `tempso.webflow.css` probably contains many global selectors and repeated rules; migrating to Tailwind will be a sizable but worthwhile cleanup.
- `normalize.css` can be replaced by Tailwind base; mixing both is usually redundant.
- Webflow-generated JS (`webflow.js`) may rely on class names and attributes that will change during migration — make a thorough inventory before deleting it.
- Animations that rely on Webflow timelines or pixel-perfect transforms may need manual recreation in Framer Motion. This could be the most time-consuming step.

## Minimal set of files to create in `tempso-com/` (starter)
- package.json
- next.config.js (if needed)
- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js
- pages/_app.js
- pages/index.js
- components/* (Header, Hero, Footer, etc.)
- styles/globals.css
- public/images/* (copied assets)

## Example Tailwind config snippet (add to `tailwind.config.js`)
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./pages/**/*.{js,jsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,jsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // copy key brand colors found in the CSS here
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: []
}
```

## Quick terminal commands (run from `tempso-com/`) — zsh
```
# install deps
npm init -y
npm install next react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer framer-motion clsx

# init tailwind
npx tailwindcss init -p

# dev
npm run dev
```

## Edge cases & checks
- Empty/null: ensure components handle missing images or content gracefully.
- Large/slow assets: optimize images and defer non-critical media.
- Prefers-reduced-motion: respect user preference in animations.
- Fonts: ensure cross-origin/hosting is handled (self-hosting preferred for performance/consistency).

## Estimated effort (very rough)
- Bootstrap + assets + basic page: 1–2 days.
- Migrate styles (heavy conversion to Tailwind): 1–3 days depending on complexity.
- Recreate animations/interactions: 1–5 days depending on how complex the Webflow interactions are.

## Next steps I can take now (pick one or tell me which to do)
1. Copy the site assets (`images/`, fonts) into `tempso-com/public/` so the homepage can reference them directly.
2. Port the existing `index.html` into `src/app/page.tsx` (TypeScript/JSX) to bring the full homepage structure into the Next app. Styling conversion to Tailwind can follow.
3. Perform a detailed audit of `css/tempso.webflow.css` and produce a mapping: selector -> Tailwind utility or scoped CSS module.
4. Start the dev server locally and verify the app runs: `npm run dev` from `tempso-com/`.

Tell me which of the above to do next and I will proceed and update this TODO list accordingly.
